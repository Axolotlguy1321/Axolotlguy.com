<h1>Other Info</h1>
<p><strong>CONTENT ADVISORY</strong><br></p>
<p>There is a scene of Cubey's hanging body, but it is very low quality, and it is hangman word.</p>
<p><strong>Saves</strong><br></p>
<p>Due to the way construct 3 saves work, the saves for the web version and the Windows version are Separate, and I can't control it.</p>
