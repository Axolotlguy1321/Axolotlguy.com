You may access files and modify, delete, and move them. Mods are allowed as long only the moddified assets are shared. NEVER share the full modded game (Included EXEs) (You can if you use the source code to mod)
You may use Cubey for your own projects as well, but don't remake my game, or copy it saying its yours.
